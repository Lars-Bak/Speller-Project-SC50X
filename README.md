# Speller-Project-SC50X
This project is based on the CS50 “Speller” assignment.  
It was developed and tested within the CS50 environment, which provides specific  
libraries, tooling, and performance measurement scripts not available in a standard setup.  
As a result, the program may not run outside that environment without modification.  

This repository is published for portfolio purposes to demonstrate my understanding of  
data structures, memory management, and algorithmic problem‑solving in C.  
All code in this project was written by me.
